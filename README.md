# react-epro

This is serverless Electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) react app build on top of create-react-app for use with Open Clinica Open Source Electronic Data Capture system (EDC) or any other backend upon modification.

This ePRO app can be used to display and collect responses to form questionnaires (incl conditional show/hide logic) from participants on PC or tablet. 
Before the participant is able to fill assigned questionnaires a login of responsible person is required - this way the participant can be left alone with the tablet on which he is filling the questionnaires without the danger of him modifying anything else.
