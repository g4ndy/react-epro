This is serverless Electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) react app build on top of create-react-app for use with OpenClinica Open Source Electronic Data Capture system (EDC) or any other backend upon modification.

This ePRO app can be used to display and collect responses to basic online form questionnaires (incl conditional show/hide logic, basic VAS scale) from participants on PC, tablet or phone.

Before the participant is able to fill any questionnaires assigned to him a login of responsible person is required. Afterwards, the participant can be left alone with the tablet on which he is filling the questionnaires without the danger of him modifying anything else. After finishing of the questionnaire, login of responsible person is required again.
